Step 1 pms_writecsv: REDCap export of participant-reported DRSP, clean up variables and re-save the data. 

Step 2 pms_dx: Generating a probable PMS diagnosis. 
Calculate the total (net) score for days -5 to -1 vs. +5 to +10. Let's call these periods LP (luteal period) vs. FP (follicular period).
If LP is greater than or equal to 50% than FP, the person has PMS. This pattern has to be present on at least 2 cycles (cycles 2 and 3). 
Additionally, any of the DRSP Items 22 through 24 have to be 3 or above in LP. 

Also included are a ridgeplot and lineplot to provide descriptive figures.
